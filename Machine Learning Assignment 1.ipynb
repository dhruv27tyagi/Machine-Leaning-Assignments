    "Q. What is labeled training set, and how does it work ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In machine learning, a labeled training set is a collection of data points where each data point is associated with a \n",
    "     corresponding label or target value. The process of creating a labeled training set is a crucial step in supervised \n",
    "     learning, which is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on input-output pairs to learn the mapping \n",
    "     between inputs and their corresponding outputs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Here's how a labeled training set works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection: To create a labeled training set, data is collected or generated, representing real-world examples of the \n",
    "problem you want the model to solve. For example, if you want to build a spam email classifier, you would collect a set of\n",
    "emails, each labeled as either \"spam\" or \"not spam.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Data labeling: Once you have the raw data, it needs to be labeled. This means associating each data point with the correct \n",
    "output or target value. In the spam email classifier example, you would manually label each email as either \"spam\" or \"not \n",
    "spam\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Data splitting: After labeling the data, it is typically split into two or more subsets: the training set and the test set. \n",
    "The training set is used to train the machine learning model, while the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model training: The labeled training set is used to train a machine learning model. During the training process, the model \n",
    "learns from the input-output pairs, adjusting its internal parameters to minimize the error or difference between the predicted \n",
    "outputs and the actual labels in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model evaluation: Once the model is trained, it is tested on the labeled test set to evaluate its performance on unseen data.\n",
    "The test set contains data that the model has not seen during training, allowing us to assess how well the model generalizes to \n",
    "new, unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model deployment: After the model has been trained and evaluated on the test set, it can be deployed to make predictions on \n",
    "new, unlabeled data. The model takes the input data and uses the knowledge acquired during training to predict the \n",
    "corresponding output or label.\n",

    "Q.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "Out-of-core learning, also known as \"online learning\" or \"streaming learning,\" is a machine learning approach that deals with \n",
    "large datasets that do not fit entirely into the computer's memory (RAM). In out-of-core learning, the data is processed and \n",
    "learned in smaller chunks, or batches, rather than loading the entire dataset into memory at once. This makes it possible to \n",
    "handle datasets that are too large to fit into RAM, allowing for more scalable and efficient learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, \"core learning\" (also referred to as \"in-core learning\" or simply \"batch learning\") is the traditional \n",
    "approach to machine learning, where the entire dataset is loaded into memory, and the learning algorithm processes all the data\n",
    "in one go. Core learning is commonly used when the dataset can comfortably fit within the available memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key differences between out-of-core learning and core learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Handling: In out-of-core learning, the data is processed in smaller batches that can fit into memory. The model is updated \n",
    "incrementally as new batches of data arrive. In contrast, core learning processes the entire dataset simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Usage: Out-of-core learning minimizes memory usage by processing data in chunks, while core learning requires sufficient \n",
    "memory to load the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: Out-of-core learning is more scalable and can handle extremely large datasets that core learning might struggle \n",
    "with due to memory limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Time: Core learning might be faster when the entire dataset fits into memory, as the model can process the data in one\n",
    "pass. Out-of-core learning might take longer due to the incremental nature of updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online Learning: Out-of-core learning is often associated with online learning, where the model continuously updates its\n",
    "parameters as new data arrives. Core learning is more commonly associated with offline learning, where the model is trained on \n",
    "a static dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out-of-core learning is particularly useful in scenarios where data arrives in a continuous stream or when dealing with datasets\n",
    "that are too large to be handled with traditional core learning approaches. Examples include real-time data processing, online\n",
    "recommendation systems, and analyzing data streams from sensors or social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between out-of-core learning and core learning depends on the size of the dataset, the available memory, and the \n",
    "nature of the learning problem. If the dataset is small enough to fit into memory, core learning may be more straightforward\n",
    "and efficient. However, for large-scale data processing, out-of-core learning becomes a valuable technique to consider."
